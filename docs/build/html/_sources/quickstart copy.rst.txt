Quick Start
=====

Through the tutorials below imports and cuttingÂ data into train and test, sets
is a standard procedure, the only thing that is changing is the pipeline and param_grid. Below is the sklearn.pipeline from which AML originated

.. code:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from feature_engine.discretisation import EqualFrequencyDiscretiser
    from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    X, y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)
    X = pd.DataFrame(X)
    y = pd.Series(y)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('disc1', EqualFrequencyDiscretiser()),
        ('model1', LinearRegression()),
    ])

    pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
